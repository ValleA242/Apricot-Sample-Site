# Apricot-Sample-Site
Web page for Bonterra Solution Architects to showcase web form potential. 

Bonterra Solution Architects have had to rely on current clients to showcase sites that house their webforms.
Customers leave or don't want us associating them with the sales process which creates a conflict of interest and an enviornment of unreliability.
This site will serve the Solutions Architects by allowing them to showcase their webforms in a more reliable way that does not include current 
customers in the sales process.
